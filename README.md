Cryptocurrency sentiment analysis

This project utilizes a Python Flask backend to pull cryptocurrency info from coinmarketcap.com. The data is displayed using DataTables. Expanding a row in the table shows tweets mentioning that coin, along with a rudimentary analysis of whether the tweet was positive, negative, or neutral. In the future, this data will be used to train an algorithm in order to improve the anlysis, as applied to cryptotwitter.
